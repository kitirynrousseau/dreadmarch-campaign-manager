## Marker Types

### **Combat Markers**
- Changed to use "Crossed Lightsabers" icons instead of swords.
- Clearly define these markers for dynamic battle locations.

### **Assets**
- Provide greater flexibility by enabling GMs to choose from a variety of icons (e.g., ships, supply boxes, buildings).
- Add a color selector to allow for custom visual distinction of assets on the map.
