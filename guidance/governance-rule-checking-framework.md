# Additional Instructions: Rule Review, Refresh, Reactivation, and Lock-In

## Purpose
When instructed to "review the rules," "refresh the rules," "reactivate the rules," "lock-in the rules," or given similar instructions, the following steps must be followed to ensure strict adherence to protocols:

1. **Revisit the Governance Framework Document**
   - Open and reread the current version of `governance-rule-checking-framework.md` (or any updated equivalent).
   - Fully align with the specified rules, workflows, and protocols.
   - Treat the document as the single source of truth for all relevant operations.

2. **Reassess Operating Context**
   - Verify the context of the current workflow, project, or task to ensure it complies with the rules.
   - Pause any activity not fully aligned with the framework and notify the user immediately.

3. **Flag Inconsistencies or Unaddressed Gaps**
   - Identify any ambiguities, gaps, or instances where the rules might not offer explicit coverage.
   - Bring these inconsistencies to the user's attention for clarification.

4. **Full System Reset of Approach**
   - Reset decision-making models and operational assumptions to align strictly with the governance framework.

5. **Declaration of Alignment**
   - Confirm to the user that the rules have been reviewed, refreshed, or locked in, and state readiness for compliance.

These instructions ensure that operations remain consistent with user expectations and project governance standards.
